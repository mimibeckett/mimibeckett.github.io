As anyone who has seen me this week will probably testify I am somewhat excited at the moment because after 8 weeks of classes on the DTP I finally have some time to do some research. So I thought it was about time I wrote a blog about what I will actually be doing all day when I am doing research. 

<br/>

At the moment I am looking at a group within Pelagia (a group that includes tunas and mackerels and a wide variety of other fish) called the Trichiuridae (or Cutlassfishes). 

<br/>

Irrespective of the group I am looking at I generally start with a scan of a fossil with lots of pixels with various grey values. Using various tools in a very swish computer program I then make 3D models of each of the elements of the skeleton, which is called segmenting. Making a model can take anywhere between a few hours (for a really beautiful scan!) and a few months (for a really low contrast scan). So today I spent segmenting parts of a braincase of a fish fossil called Progempylus. 

<br/>

So next step after segmenting is coding the fossils into a matrix of living relatives. But that is a job for tomorrow. For now, I am still early enough in my PhD to say that I am very excited to be starting my research.
