title: "What Is a 'Critical Moment' in Earth History?"
modified:
categories: 
excerpt: I spent 4 years studying geology so when posed that question I immediately think of mass extinctions, or large igneous provinces or the origin of life on earth, things that occur on timescales of millions of years. However this week when we were posed that same question in one of our lectures it highlighted how different the perspectives of those who are on this course are. Some interpret this question very differently, thinking of ideas including the industrial revolution and the development of agriculture. Whilst I personally would argue that these are not major events in the history of the Earth, they are obviously major events in *our* history, and we (humans) are in ourselves likely to be a major event in the history of the Earth.

This got me thinking about the impact that we are having on the Earth and how we might be represented in the geological record. Will we be able to tell when there was large-scale development of agriculture? It will clearly affect the soils and we can see this on historical timescales but will it be seen in the geological record? Likewise the industrial revolution caused large changes in our society and led to large-scale inputs of carbon and gasses into our atmosphere, will this be recorded? Will our rubbish dumps show up in the geological record as carbon rich areas of rocks from all the plastic?      

<br/>

For something to make it into the sedimentary record, the environment generally has to be pervasive, it has to last for some length of time, and there is not a little bit of chance/luck involved.  Sedimentary rocks make up a small proportion of rocks preserved on earth at <10%, and of these sedimentary rocks a similarly small proportion are those sediments formed in continental environments. There is therefore a very small chance that human effects in continental settings will make it into the geological record since we are mainly based on land. So on its own I am not sure we would be able to see agriculture in the record, and if I was looking back in a 100 million years, I?m not sure it would count as a major event in earth's history. Perhaps if it were as pervasive as banded iron formations (BIFs), or caused a significantly sudden change in the isotope record.      

<br/>

Whilst I am not sure that such specific events as the development of agriculture will show up, I am more convinced that the cumulative effect of us as humans might be a big enough to see. If you consider that agriculture caused population growth further supported by the industrial revolution, which in turn led to the huge increase in CO2 we see today then the human affected environment as a whole might show up. Squashed into one layer of geological time would be the entirety of human life, with isotope excursions indicating the current changing climate and maybe some human fossils and some odd rocks here and there.      

<br/>

Having considered that, maybe we wont be such a critical moment, it all depends on how long we last!
