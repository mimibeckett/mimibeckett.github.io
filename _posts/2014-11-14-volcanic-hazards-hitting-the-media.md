Recently volcanic hazards have been hitting the media as there have been a number of eruptions causing loss of human life or livelihoods. I have always found the interaction of volcanoes and the human environment interesting, and even though I have now settled on an area of research outside of volcanology, I can’t forget that it was what brought me into Earth Sciences in the first place.<br/>
There are a number of volcanic hazards that can cause death and destruction, as every GCSE and A-level student will know. In the news at the moment there is the lava flow that has caused the evacuation of a settlement in Hawaii [(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-29805102)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-29805102). Lava flows are perhaps one of the most well known hazards of volcanic eruptions, but they are in some respects the least dangerous to human life. As is illustrated by the Hawaii example this is because humans can often run faster than a lava flow! Whilst lava flows aren’t often devastating to human life, they can cause significant damage to property and livelihoods as they cover large swathes of land.

Ash and Tephra fall is also a relatively well known hazard of volcanoes but it can be surprisingly dangerous.  Mt Pinatubo erupted in June 1991 in a cataclysmic Plinian eruption. It produced large amounts of tephra and ash, which accumulated, on roofs to up to a depth of 15cm [(http://pubs.usgs.gov/pinatubo/spence/)](http://pubs.usgs.gov/pinatubo/spence/). Unfortunately the eruption coincided with Typhoon Yunya and the wet ash caused collapse of roofs killing at least 320 people *[(ibid.)](http://pubs.usgs.gov/pinatubo/spence/)*.

In combination with ash, gas from volcanic eruptions can be deadly. Going back a few more weeks in the news there was the Japanese Hiker tragedy after Mt Ontake erupted killing at least 36 people [(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-29405466)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-29405466). It seems that those killed were overcome with a combination of gas and ash. However gas is not always associated with visible eruptions in volcanic systems, the most frequent type of volcanic activity is passive degassing. The most famous example of passive degassing severely affecting human life is the 1986 Lake Nyos disaster in Cameroon where 1700 people and indeed all living things within a 15 mile radias of the volcanic crater lake were killed by a cloud of CO2 gas.  Whilst it is not thought that a volcanic eruption caused the release of gas it is thought to be related to the volcanic system. It is thought that CO2 from volcanic systems dissolved in groundwater and then filtered into the lake. This caused a build up of CO2 gas in the stratified lake where it was trapped in the base of the lake safely stored. However overturning of the lake released gas which is denser than air and so suffocates all in its path. Pyroclastic flows are commonly associated with explosive eruptions and are fast moving flows of hot gas and rock which by their very description suggest danger. Without a doubt the most famous eruption associated with pyroclastic flows is the eruption of Vesuvius and the burial of Pompeii. More recently, in 1902 Mt Pelee on the French-Caribeean island of Martinique erupted killing all but two of St Pierre’s approximately 28,000 inhabitants. Less extreme but in the modern era, Soufrière Hills, Montserrat provides an excellent case study for Pyroclastic flows. Soufrière Hills has been erupting since 1995 and pyroclastic flows have both added land to the island and destroyed the capital, Plymouth. The eruption of Mt St Helens in 1980 also formed a pyroclastic flow as a result of the catastrophic collapse of one of its flanks. The pyroclastic flow flattened trees around the volcano and killed 57 people.

The eruption of Mt St Helens also led to the creation of lahars, the final hazard that I have to discuss. Lahars are fast, powerful, dense flows of mud and rock, which are the result of ash mixing with water or ice.  The lahars from Mt St Helens carried trees and debris nearly 30 kilometres downstream along rivers, destroying bridges along their way. However what I would call the classic case study for Lahars is the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz, Columbia. A small eruption melted the ice cap and the ash and dust mixed with the ice to form a lahar that swept through the town of Armero, killing an estimated 23,000 people [(http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/13/newsid_2539000/2539731.stm)](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/13/newsid_2539000/2539731.stm). This generated an enormous amount of publicity at the time because an ordered evacuation was cancelled and the crisis was generally badly managed by the authorities. One of the most recognised images was of a little girl, [Omayra Sánchez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omayra_S%C3%A1nchez), trapped in the lahar for days before she died. 
<br/>Not to devolve into a session worrying about the hazards and dangers of being near a volcano I feel I should point out that there are advantages too! Fertile soils and historic settlements mean people continue to live near volcanoes, so it is in understanding these hazards and mitigating the dangers they pose which is important now and in the future.
