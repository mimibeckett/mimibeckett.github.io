I am a first year DPhil student at St Hugh's College, Oxford. 

My research interests lie broadly in comparative anatomy, phylogeny and evolutionary processes of various teleost groups using CT scanning and statistical methods. 
I have a Master of Earth Sciences (2010-2014) from the University of Oxford where my masters project focussed on Lizardfishes (Aulopiformes) looking at their relationships and divergence times over the K-Pg boundary using CT data and "tip-dating" analyses.

# Current Research

I am in my first year of a DPhil at Oxford University, funded by NERC on the Environmental Research Doctoral Training Programme (DTP). My project will focus on the relationships between Scombroids and investigate their rates of evolution and radiation after the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary using both fossil and modern data.
