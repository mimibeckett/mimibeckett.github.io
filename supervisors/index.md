I am co-supervised by [Matt Friedman](http://www.earth.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/academic/mattf) (Oxford) and [Zerina Johanson](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/about-science/staff-directory/earth-sciences/z-johanson/) (Natural History Museum, London). I am working within the [Friedman Lab in Oxford](https://sites.google.com/site/friedmanlaboxford/home).
